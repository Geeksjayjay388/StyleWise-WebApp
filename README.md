# 👗 StyleWise – AI-Powered Fashion Assistant

Welcome to **StyleWise**, a fashion recommendation platform we built to help people discover outfits that truly match their style, preferences, and skin tone. This project was created by **Jacob Sihul** and **Becky Cherop**—two passionate Software Engineering students at UEAB who believe that style should be smart, inclusive, and personalized.

StyleWise uses AI to guide users through a conversational flow, asking questions about their outfit goals, comfort, colors, and skin tone. At the end, it generates curated outfit suggestions with visual previews to inspire confident dressing.

## Our Journey
We built StyleWise because we saw a gap in how fashion apps serve real people. Most platforms focus on trends—but we wanted something that listens. Something that adapts to your vibe, your skin tone, your comfort zone.

We trained our AI to understand style goals and generate outfit suggestions that feel authentic. It’s not just about clothes—it’s about confidence, identity, and intelligent design.
